Cordova SSH Plugin v0.1.x release notes
==============================================

## v0.1.0

This is the first version of the plugin, with few support to attend basic needs.

### Cordova/Phonegap Compatibility

The following versions of Cordova/Phonegap were used to test this plugin:

* Cordova 3.4
* Phonegap 3.4


### Platforms support

Platforms supported by this plugin:

* iOS 7.x and later


### Limitations

By now, the only limitation is the fact the copyToRemote method works with TEMPORARY files only. 
Soon I hope to release a new version covering PERSISTENT files.
